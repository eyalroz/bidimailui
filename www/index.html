<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->
<div class="main-content english-content">
<p>Users of languages that are written from right to left, such as Arabic, Persian and Hebrew, require special support in many applications, including those provided by the Mozilla project: the web browser and the mail & newsgroups client. Not only is backend support required for manipulation and display of content in different directions - such as is to be found, usually to satisfaction, in the Mozilla suite, the Firefox browser and the Thunderbird mail client - necessary, but the user interface for making use of such capabilities must also be made available.</p>
<p>For this reason the <strong>BiDi UI project</strong> @ MozDev exists: to offer extensions which provide user interface for direction control and use of direction-related unicode features, as well the smoothing over of some kinks in underlying BiDi support.</p>

<p>Currently, two extensions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/browser/">BiDi Browser UI</a>, for the Mozilla suite and the Firefox browsers; this extension is partly obsolete (see link for details).
<li><a href="/mail/">BiDi Mail UI</a>, for the Mozilla suite and the Thundebird Mail&News clients
</ul>
</p>

<p>Both of these partially correspond to BiDi-related bugzilla bugs (see the two subsections for bug numbers), and can also be thought of as workarounds for them.</p>

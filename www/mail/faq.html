<p class="question">The extension does not detect the direction of my message!</h4>
<p class="answer">This could be due to one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Mozilla has mis-detected the message encoding, so the extension is not aware that there are actually any RTL-script characters in the message.
<li>Your message contains both RTL and LTR text, and the detection algorithm simply works differently than your intuition for the message.
<li>The message is in HTML rather than plain text.
<li>You have disabled automatic message direction detection in the preferences dialog.
</ul>

<h3><a name="installation_and_removal">Installation & Removal</a></h3>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">I have some version of Moofie's hebmailpack installed. What should I do before installing BiDi Mail UI?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>That depends on whether you have the version Moofie made specifically for Thunderbird. To check whether you have that version installed, take a look at the Thunderbird extension panel. If you see Moofie's extension (the word 'Hebmailpack', or something mentioning Hebrew Mail or BiDi) - remove it as you would normally remove a Thunderbird extension - using the Uninstall button.</p>
<p>If the extension does not appear in the panel, or if you're using the Mozilla suite, you will have to manually remove the old extension: Follow the instructions <a href="http://bidiui.mozdev.org/mail/installation.html#הוראות_הסרה_ידנית_מספריית_הפרופיל_האישי_של_מוזילה">here</a>, using the name <code>hebmailpack</code> instead of <code>bidimailpack</code>.</p>
<p> <em>Note: Moofie's extension must also be manually removed from Thunderbird if it does not appear in the extension panel, so in this case the removal instructions apply to both Thunderbird and Mozilla suite!</em></p>
<p>Now install the new extension.</p>

<h3><a name="direction_detection">Automatic Direction Detection</a></h3>
<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">I've received this message, and the extension did not set its direction correctly. Why?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>This could be due to one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mozilla has mis-detected the message encoding, so the extension is not aware that there are actually any RTL-script characters in the message.
<li>Your message contains both RTL and LTR text, and the detection algorithm simply works differently than your intuition for the message.
<li>The message is in HTML rather than plain text.
<li>You have set the <code>mailnews.message_display.autodetect_direction</code> preference to <code>false</code>, disabling automatic message direction detection.
</ul>

<h3><a name="keyboard_behavior">Keyboard Behavior</a></h3>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">Why does direction switching not use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+LeftShift and Ctrl+RightShift, like in Microsoft Windows and popular Hebrew keyboard layouts for X?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>We are hoping to eventually do so, but we are not yet able to, due to problems in keyboard input handling in Mozilla.</p>

<h3><a name="replying_to_messages">Replying to Messages</a></h3>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">When I reply to a Right-to-Left message, the message-quote bar continues to appear on the left of the message instead of moving over to the right. Can I make it behave the way I want to?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>This issue has been fixed in version 0.5.1 .</p>
<p>Also, here are some extra rules for <code>userContent.css</code> which will change the color of quoted text based on the quote depth:</p>
<div class="code-segment">blockquote[type=cite] {
  color: #660066 !important;
}
blockquote[type=cite] blockquote {
  color: #007777 !important;
}
blockquote[type=cite] blockquote blockquote {
  color: #990000 !important;
}
blockquote[type=cite] blockquote blockquote blockquote {
  color: #000099 !important;
}
blockquote[type=cite] blockquote blockquote blockquote blockquote {
  color: #bb6600 !important;
}
</div>
<p>Remember you can disable the bar altogether and see the textual quote '&gt;' marks, by the setting the preference <code>mail.quoted_graphical</code> to <code>false</code>; do so using the <code>about:config</code> URL in the Mozilla suite or by adding the following line to your profile's <code>user.js</code> file:
<div class="code-segment">pref("mail.quoted_graphical", false);</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">When I reply to a Right-to-Left message, the reply composer is not always aligned to the right when it opens.</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>This is a known issue in some configurations. It will be fixed when we figure out the cause of this failure.</p>

<h3><a name="miscellany">Miscellany</a></h3>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">I noticed that some code from the BiDi Browser UI extension was incorporated into the Mozilla codebase. Can we expect this to happen with this extension also? How soon?</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>That's a very perceptive question... it is possible that code adoption will also happen with this extension, but there are no immediate plans for something like this. If you want to pester somebody more authoritative on this issue, take it up with one of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html">owners or peers</a> of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html#Mail/News">Mail/News</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html#Standalone%20Mail">Standalone Mail</a>, or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html#Composer">Composer</a> modules.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">Why does the extension change the behavior of the <code>Enter</code> key? I want the default 'Body Text'-style behavior back...</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>You can revert to the default <code>Enter</code> key behavior by setting the preference:
<div class="code-segment">pref("mailnews.alternative_enter_behavior", false);</div></p>
</div>

<div class="faq-item">
<div class="question">I have another issue which is not covered in this FAQ...</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>That's great! Submit a bug in our <a href="/bugs.html">bugs</a> section. Make sure to give as much detail as possible, and provide instructions for reproducing your problem.</p>

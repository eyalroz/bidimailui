<p>BiDi Mail UI supports Thunderbird v1.5.x, Mozilla
Suite Mail&amp;News v1.7.x - v1.8.x and Seamonkey Mail&News 1.x (previous versions of BiDi Mail UI supported earlier versions of Thunderbird and Mozilla Suite).
It has been successfully tested
under Windows, Mac OS X and Linux+X.Org. It is most likely, though we
can't guarantee it, to work fine with other versions and operating
systems.</p>

  <li>Right click the download link below</li>
  <li>Save the XPI file to your hard drive</li>
  <li>Launch Thunderbird</li>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Extensions<br>

</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li>If previous BiDi Mail UI versions are installed, make sure to remove
them as described in section 3</li>
  <li>Click the download link below</li>
  <li>Confirm the installation when prompted<br>

</li>
  <li>Choose whether you wish to install the extension in your
personal profile folder or globally, in the application folder.
Installation in the profile folder has a few advantages: There is no
need to have root user privileges (in operating systems such as Linux)
and there is no need to reinstall the extension after updating Seamonkey
to a new version. However, with operating systems that are oriented
toward single user mode (such as Windows 98), but that are accessed by
several users, it is preferable to install BiDi Mail UI in the Seamonkey
application folder, so that everyone can utilize it. This global
installation may require root privileges in some operating systems.
Note that installing the extension as root also requires to restart
Mozilla as root.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is finished (with a 'success' or a
      'need to restart' message) - you must restart Mozilla. Make
sure to close all the program's windows - Browser, Mail&amp;News,
Composer et cetera.</li>

<p>To overcome possible difficulties in step #3, it may be worthwhile
to run the installation locally. Simply right click the XPI file, save
it to your hard drive and double click it to start the installation.<br>

<p>There is no need to install this extension in newer browser
since its functionality is now built in. It is usually much preferred
to
install a new browser than to install this extension in an old one.<br>

<h2><a name="ExtensionRemoval"> Removing the Extension</a></h2>

<p>Below are instructions for removing (uninstalling) the BiDi Mail UI extension.
If, for any reason, your experience with the extension has been less than satisfactory,
please let us know. You can find our contact details above.</p>
<h3><a name="RemovalFromThunderbird"> Removal from Thunderbird</a></h3>
<p>Open the Extensions manager (<code>Tools | Extensions</code> menu item).
Locate the BiDi Mail UI entry and click the Uninstall button.</p>

<h3><a name="RemovalFromMozilla"> Removal from Seamonkey/Mozilla Suite</a></h3>

<p>The Mozilla suite does not have a built-in uninstaller for extensions, but you can try using the <a href="http://multizilla.mozdev.org/">Multizilla</a> extension, which allows disabling extensions.</p>

<p>If you want to `physicall' remove the extension, you can do it manually:
follow the instructions that correspond to your chosen
installation method (i.e. application folder or profile folder).</p>

<h4><a name="ManualRemovalFromMozilla"> Manual
Removal from the Seamonkey/Mozilla Suite application folder </a></h4>

<p>The following instructions only apply to Seamonkey, not to Thunderbird.</p>
<p><em>Note: This procedure must be followed carefully, since manually deleting
or modifying files in the applicationdirectory can be dangerous. Do not delete
or modify anything you are not <strong>absolutely</strong> certain you should
be deleting or modifying!</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Close Seamonkey.</li>
  <li>Open Seamonkey's <code>chrome</code> folder</li>
  <li>Edit the file installed-chrome.txt and delete any line that
contains the string <code>bidimailpack.jar</code>.</li>
  <li>Delete the file <code>bidimailpack.jar</code> .</li>
  <li>Delete the folder <code>overlayinfo</code> and everyting it contains.</li>
  <li>Delete the file <code>chrome.rdf</code> .</li>
  <li>Start Seamonkey again (in Linux, do it as root if needed). Seamonkey
will now regenerate the deleted <code>overlayinfo</code> folder and the <code>chrome.rdf</code> file.
</ol>

<h4><a name="ManualRemovalFromMozillaProfile"> Manual
Removal from the Your User Profile Folder </a></h4>
<p>
The following instructions only apply to Seamonkey/Mozilla Suite, not to Thunderbird.</p>
<p><em>Note: This procedure must be followed carefully, since manually deleting
or modifying files in your profile directory can be dangerous. Do not delete
or modify anything you are not <strong>absolutely</strong> certain you should
be deleting or modifying!</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Close Seamonkey.</li>
  <li>Open your profile's <code>chrome</code> folder - the files mentioned
  below are all located there.</li>
  <li>Delete the file <code>bidimailpack.jar</code>.</li>
  <li>In the <code>chrome</code> directory there is a subdirectory named <code>overlayinfo</code>,
  which in turn has several sub-directories of its own. Some of these contain a file named <code>overlay.rdf</code>. Edit this file in all subdirectories of <code>overlayinfo</code>:
delete the tags beginning with <code>&lt;RDF:Seq RDF:about</code>
that contain the word <code>bidimailpack</code> (note these may be multi-line tags!).</li>
  <li>Edit the file <code>chrome.rdf</code> in the chrome folder: Delete
the lines that begin with <code>RDF:li</code> and contain the word <code>bidimailpack</code> (not the tags containing them, just the lines themselves); also, delete the tags that begin with <code>&lt;RDF:Seq RDF:about</code> and contain the word <code>bidimailpack</code> (these too may be multi-line).</li>
  <li>Start Seamonkey again.</li>
</ol>

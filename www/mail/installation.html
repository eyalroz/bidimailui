<h2><a id="content" name="התקנת_התוסף"> Installation </a></h2>

<h3><a name="דרישות_קדם"> Prerequisites </a></h3>
<p>BiDi Mail UI supports Thunderbird v0.7.x - v0.9.x, as well as Mozilla
Suite Mail&amp;News v1.4.x - v1.8.x. It has been successfully tested
under Windows, Mac OS X and Linux+X.Org. It is most likely, though we
can't guarantee it, to work fine with other versions and operating
systems.</p>
<h3><a name="הוראות_התקנה_עבור_Thunderbird"> Installation under
Thunderbird<br>
</a></h3>


<ol>
  <li>Right click the download link below</li>
  <li>Save the XPI file to your hard drive</li>
  <li>Launch Thunderbird</li>
  <li>Open the Tools menu and choose Extensions<br>

</li>
  <li>Click Install</li>
  <li>Browse to the folder where you've saved the XPI file, select it,
then confirm</li>
  <li>Restart Thunderbird when prompted</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="הוראות_התקנה_עבור_מוזילה"> Installation under Mozilla<br>
</a></h3>
<ol>
  <li>If previous BiDi Mail UI versions are installed, make sure to remove
them as described in section 3</li>
  <li>Click the download link below</li>
  <li>Confirm the installation when prompted<br>

</li>
  <li>Choose whether you wish to install the extension in your
personal profile folder or globally, in the application folder.
Installation in the profile folder has a few advantages: There is no
need to have root user privileges (in operating systems such as Linux)
and there is no need to reinstall the extension after updating Mozilla
to a new version. However, with operating systems that are oriented
toward single user mode (such as Windows 98), but that are accessed by
several users, it is preferable to install BiDi Mail UI in the Mozilla
application folder, so that everyone can utilize it. This global
installation may require root privileges in some operating systems.
Note that installing the extension as root also requires to restart
Mozilla as root.</li>
  <li>Once the installation is finished (with a 'success' or a
      'need to restart' message) - you must restart Mozilla. Make
sure to close all the program's windows - Browser, Mail&amp;News,
Composer et cetera.</li>
</ol>

<p>To overcome possible difficulties in step #3, it may be worthwhile
to run the installation locally. Simply right click the XPI file, save
it to your hard drive and double click it to start the installation.<br>

<h3><a name="התקנת_התוסף_הישן_לדפדפנים">Installation of the previous
BiDi UI (browser extension) </a></h3>
<p>Users of old versions of Mozilla, Firefox and Netscape may be
interested in the previous (browser-oriented) extension:<br>

<p>There is no need to install this extension in newer browser
since its functionality is now built in. It is usually much preferred
to
install a new browser than to install this extension in an old one.<br>

<h2><a name="הסרת_התוסף"> Removing the Extension </a></h2>

<p>Below are instructions for removing (uninstalling) the BiDi Mail UI extension.
If, for any reason, your experience with the extension has been less than satisfactory,
please let us know. You can find our contact details above.</p>
<h3><a name="הוראות_הסרה_מ-Thunderbird"> Removal from Thunderbird</a></h3>
<p>Open the Extensions manager (<code>Tools | Extensions</code> menu item).
Locate the BiDi Mail UI entry and click the Uninstall button.</p>

<h3><a name="הוראות_הסרה_מ-Mozilla"> Removal from the Mozilla Suite</a></h3>

<p>The Mozilla suite does not have a built-in uninstaller for extensions, but you can try using Jeremy Gillick's <a href="http://jgillick.nettripper.com/extuninstaller">Extension Uninstaller</a>; this should probably work.</p>

<p>If the uninstaller doesn't work for some reason, try manual removal:
follow the instructions that correspond to your chosen
installation method (i.e. application folder or profile folder).</p>

<h4><a name="הוראות_הסרה_ידנית_מספריית_היישום_של_מוזילה"> Manual

<p><em>Note: This procedure must be followed carefully, since manually deleting

<ol>
  <li>Close Mozilla.</li>

delete the tags beginning with <code>&lt;RDF:Seq RDF:about</code>
that contain the word <code>bidimailpack</code> (note these may be multi-line tags!).</li>

  <li>Start Mozilla again.</li>

<u><b>Changing page direction</b></u>

<p>Plain text content is Left-to-Right and left aligned by default. A common case where this poses a problem are plain text Hebrew emails displayed in the browser. Such emails are displayed as Left-to-Right and left aligned, thus <a href="http://oren.gomen.org/mozilla/why_bidi_ui_is_needed.html">breaking word order and punctuation</a>.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, right click the page and choose <b>Switch Page Direction</b>. The same command is also available under the View menu.</p>

<u><b>Changing textarea direction</b></u>

<p>Unlike the page-oriented control which is mostly useful when reading content, the textarea control is useful when writing in forms. This is commonly needed when composing a Right-to-Left email in webmail service that only provides Left-to-Right interface (most of the major services such as Hotmail and Yahoo suffer from this limitation).</p>

<p>To change the direction of a textarea or a single line input field, right click it and choose <b>Switch Text Direction</b>. Alternatively you may use the same command under the Edit menu or press Ctrl+Shift+E (Cmd+Shift+E on Mac OS X).</p>
